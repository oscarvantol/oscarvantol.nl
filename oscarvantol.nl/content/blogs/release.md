# Remove the bottlenecks - start at the end

I get challenges like:
- How can we improve productivity?
- Move faster
- Sprints aren't completed
- etc

ofc you see instantly all kinds of issues that can be addressed around workflow. but i always try to step back first to investigate what would happen if this issues werent there. You can actually skip everything and ask the question, how en when is the increment hitting the actual user. The last step can be a release, an (a-b), blue-green and or ring deployment or even the last step could be a feature toggle. How is the quality, feedback loop, metrics? Is there human interaction involved, who descides the "go" and who can block it.


from there you move backwards towards the build/release of the increment. Are there any quality checks in place like test automation or pentests is this a blocking process? Is making the release automated, is it just the latest build of a main branch? Or is someone planning the release, making a branch and crunching to get it perfect. 

All of this will give you insights on how the team is working and why. It is not only about what you build that gets into the increment but the way you deliver it to the release pipeline. If you have a clear vision of what you want you have grip on what done should look like and what feedback loops are in place.

In a lot of cases it will be more easy to determine the constraints of 


working with multiple teams and multiple companies
slowing down, not performing, not finishing stories, complicated, unreliable, roadmapping

measure is not solving anything

start at the end, how would you like to ship? constraints, regulatory, distribution?
some solvable with engineering
feature toggles/dark launches

"Your increment does not have to cool down"

risk assessment, timing
remove friction, external dependencies (qa teams)


getting closer to the team.

business cannot handle it?

the tech is easy
